Network Access
--------------

During the game, you will connect to a network with a real CAT5 ethernet cable.  This
cable will provide access to Internet and in-game resources.  **Turn off your wifi.**

.. NOTE::
   You **must** use the ethernet port on the table in front you.  It's the only 
   way to access in game resources.  If you need an adapter/dongle, now would be the 
   time to speak up.
