Getting Started
---------------

Thanks for participating in our Hack to the Future CTF!  Hopefully, you enjoy it.  By now
you should know your team name, team members and be at the table to compete.  I'll wait 
while you make your way there..

Once you're comfortable, take a look through each of the topics.  They'll guide you through
getting connected to the game network and what to access once you're there.  Be sure to
read the strategy guide for a couple of very helpful hints.


Basic Gameplay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Goal:  Have the most money in your bank account by end of the game.  Money is earning by 
turning in flags.  Flags are nothing more than a text string that look something like:
``FLAG=924e461726d984a678301222f2c1a81b``  So how do you get FLAGS?


Complete Missions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Login to the Scoreboard and under the Game menu you'll find Missions.  There are several
levels of missions to explore.  Each level has a few different categories and a variety of 
topics.  Pick one, complete the mission, find the flag, get the money.  It's like picking up
a side hussle for a little extra cash..


Protect Your Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the game environment, there are many custobots trying to reach your Killer App.  The
only way this app makes money is if it's online.  If the custobots can use your app, you'll 
automatically get paid every few minutes.  If they can't, no cash for you.  

.. HINT:: The custobots are fairly patient, so they'll forgive a blip or two every once in a while.
