Game Resources
--------------

Now that you're connected, there are a number of systems that you may need to interact 
with during the game.  You'll primarily be interacting with the systems below.

.. NOTE:: Credentials will be provided to each team at game start.


Scoreboard 
^^^^^^^^^^

Missions, flag submissions, etc are all done through the scoreboard:  |scoreboard|
Pre-determined credentials will be provided to each team on a printed page.  **Guard your credentials!**


Team Resources 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each team will be given access to an F5 |bip| that provides connectivity to a poorly written
but highly profitable application.  Use the F5 |bip| to ensure the application is protected from |enemy|.
